  ### Why Focus on Experience?

  Human-Centered Design (HCD) is not just about solving problems but about solving the right problems in a way that is deeply rooted in human experience. Focusing on experience allows us to understand the emotional, cognitive, and physical aspects of the user journey. This is particularly important for Assessment 3, where the aim is to create a comprehensive journey map.

  

  

  

  

  Markdown

  ## Experience Categories

  ### Primary, Secondary, and Systemic Experiences

  For the purpose of Assessment 3, it's beneficial to categorize experiences into three main types:

  1. **Primary Experiences**: These are the core interactions that the user has with the service or product. They are the most direct and impactful.
  2. **Secondary Experiences**: These are peripheral interactions that support the primary experiences. They might not be as impactful but contribute to the overall user journey.
  3. **Systemic Experiences**: These are broader experiences that are influenced by the system in which the service or product exists. They include cultural, social, and environmental factors.

  ### Method for Brainstorming and Structuring Experiences

  1. **Idea Generation**: Use techniques like mind-mapping or affinity diagramming to generate ideas for each category.
  2. **Prioritization**: Rank the experiences based on their impact and feasibility.
  3. **Integration**: Finally, integrate these categorized experiences into the journey map.

The assessment will be graded based on the depth of user research, the comprehensiveness of the journey map, and the quality of analysis and recommendations.









Markdown

## Experience Categories: Primary, Secondary, Systemic

### Primary Experiences

These are the core interactions that the user has with the service or product. For example, in a journey map for a healthcare service, this could include the patient's interaction with healthcare providers.

### Secondary Experiences

These are peripheral interactions that support the primary experiences. In the healthcare example, this could include the patient's interaction with the reception desk or the billing department.

### Systemic Experiences

These are experiences that are not directly visible to the user but affect their overall experience. For instance, the healthcare service's internal processes for medical record-keeping would fall under this category.

### Importance

Understanding these categories helps in creating a more holistic journey map. It allows for a nuanced understanding of the user's experience, revealing opportunities for improvement that might not be immediately obvious.









Markdown

## Methodology for Brainstorming Experience Categories

### Step 1: Identify Touchpoints

List all the touchpoints in the user's journey. Use post-it notes or a digital tool to make this an interactive exercise.

### Step 2: Categorize Experiences

Assign each touchpoint to one of the three experience categories: Primary, Secondary, or Systemic.

### Step 3: Deep Dive

For each category, delve deeper into what the user feels, thinks, and experiences. Use techniques like empathy mapping or user interviews for this.

### Step 4: Identify Pain Points and Opportunities

Based on the deep dive, identify pain points and opportunities for improvement in each category.

### Step 5: Prioritize

Use a prioritization matrix to decide which pain points and opportunities should be addressed first.

### Step 6: Ideate Solutions

Brainstorm potential solutions for the prioritized pain points and opportunities. Use techniques like SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) for ideation.









Markdown

## Applying the Structure to Journey Maps

### Step 1: Create a Basic Journey Map

Start by creating a basic journey map that outlines the touchpoints, emotions, and pain points. Use a tool like X-Qual or any other journey mapping software.

## Importance of Psychology in Human-Centered Design

### Why Focus on Experience?

Human-centered design is not just about solving problems; it's about understanding and designing for the human experience. The experience is a complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral elements. Focusing on experience allows us to:

- **Understand Needs**: Get to the root of what people truly need, not just what they say they want.
- **Identify Pain Points**: Understand where the service is failing to meet expectations.
- **Build Empathy**: Develop a deeper connection with the user, leading to more effective solutions.

### Categories of Experience

Experiences can be grouped into three categories:

1. **Primary Experiences**: These are the core interactions that the user has with the service. They are essential for the service to fulfill its basic function.
2. **Secondary Experiences**: These are the additional features or interactions that enhance the primary experience.
3. **Systemic Experiences**: These are the overarching systems and structures that the service is a part of. They can include cultural, social, or institutional elements.

Understanding these categories helps in better structuring the journey map and focusing on what really matters.









Markdown

## Classical Psychological Concepts in Service Design

### Classical Conditioning

Classical conditioning, a concept introduced by Ivan Pavlov, can be used to create positive associations with a service. For example, rewarding users with a small discount or a free item after a certain number of visits can condition them to associate the service with positive rewards.

### Cognitive Dissonance

Understanding cognitive dissonance can help in designing services that align with the user's beliefs and values, thereby reducing discomfort and increasing satisfaction.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Maslow's hierarchy can be used to understand the different levels of needs that a service must fulfill, from basic functional needs to emotional and self-actualization needs.

### The Halo Effect

This psychological phenomenon can be leveraged in service design to create a positive first impression, which can then influence subsequent interactions.

These concepts can be integrated into the journey map to provide a more nuanced understanding of user behavior and needs.









Markdown

## Behavioral Design Techniques in Service Design

Behavioral design techniques are strategies that leverage insights from behavioral psychology to influence user behavior. These techniques can be particularly useful in service design for encouraging desired actions or discouraging undesired ones.

### Nudging

Nudging involves subtly guiding the user towards making a particular choice without removing other options. For example, placing healthier food options at eye level in a cafeteria nudges people to make healthier choices.

### Gamification

Incorporating game-like elements into a service can make the experience more engaging and rewarding. This can be particularly effective in services that require long-term engagement.

### Loss Aversion

People tend to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. This principle can be used in service design to encourage commitment. For example, a service could offer a free trial but require a credit card to sign up, leveraging the user's aversion to losing the free trial.

### Social Proof

People are influenced by the actions of others. Showcasing testimonials or ratings can build trust and encourage engagement.

These techniques can also be mapped onto the journey map to identify opportunities for behavioral interventions.









Markdown

## Method for Empathetically Planning a Human-Centered Experience

Given the importance of focusing on experience and the insights we can gain from psychology, it's crucial to have a structured method for planning a human-centered experience.

### Steps for Brainstorming and Structuring the Journey Map

1. **Identify the User Persona**: Understand who the user is, their needs, and their pain points.
2. **Map the Current Journey**: Identify all the touchpoints and categorize them into primary, secondary, and systemic experiences.
3. **Apply Psychological Concepts**: Use classical psychological concepts to understand user behavior at each touchpoint.
4. **Identify Behavioral Interventions**: Look for opportunities to apply behavioral design techniques.
5. **Prioritize Touchpoints**: Based on the insights gained, prioritize which touchpoints need immediate attention.
6. **Ideate Solutions**: Brainstorm potential solutions for each prioritized touchpoint.
7. **Prototype and Test**: Create low-fidelity prototypes and test them with users to gather feedback.

This method ensures that the journey map is not just a tool for visualization but a strategic instrument for empathetic and effective service design.

## Case Study Analysis: Public Service Transformation

In the case study provided, a director general in a major cosmopolitan city used journey mapping to transform public services for investors. The journey map revealed that an investor had to go through 28 separate steps, taking an average of 170 days to start a new business. This was clearly inefficient and unattractive for potential investors.

### Key Takeaways

- **Holistic View**: Journey maps provide a holistic view of the service, revealing hidden problems that might not be apparent through traditional research methods.
- **Problem Framing**: The journey map helped in framing the problem accurately, identifying areas for improvement.
- **Behavioral Insights**: The case study reaffirms the importance of understanding user behavior and expectations. For instance, the lack of clear online information was a significant pain point for investors.
- **Empathy**: The journey map helped the team to build a systematic mindset of empathy, uncovering layers of insights about the touchpoints, motivations, and emotions of the users.

This case study serves as a practical example of how integrating psychology and behavioral design into service design can lead to transformative results.
